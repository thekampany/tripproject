# tripproject
You and your friends go on a trip. This app allows you to share all the details of the trip with the people going on the trip with you.
It is the app in which you answer questions like: what time do we have to be at the airport, should I dress up for dinner or do we go to the beach and eat something there afterwards. 

Not only can you tell the ones going with you on the trip to just look in the app, you can also get them to be involved in (road)tripbingo and let them win fancy badges. 

The Trippers can invite their friends and family to the tribe. People in the tribe can see an overview of the trip and who is winning the badges.
